# Othello

Java implementation of the [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) game. The project was part of the course in Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at ITU.

The goal of the project was to implement an AI that can play the Othello game. It implements the Minimax algorithm and applies concepts such as alpha-beta pruning and heuristics for optimized performance.
